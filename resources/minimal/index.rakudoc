This is a page so that a minimal site can be created.

RakuDoc is a human-readable markup language that has markup and customisation
included.

The L<compliance document|rakudociem-ipsum> for RakuDoc v2 has examples of as many as possible RakuDoc features.

The RakuDoc renderer used by I<Elucid8> is B<Rakuast::RakuDoc::Render> and it implements all of the
mandatory elements. It also implements many additional blocks, which can be seen in
L<RakuDoc extras example|examples>.
